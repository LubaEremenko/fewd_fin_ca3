#### Project Summary
In this project, I was given the opportunity to demonstrate everything that I could learn in the course fewd.
The purpose of the project is to prepare a web resume using html, css and ather languages. 

#### Development Process
The basic idea was that the web resume should be like a real paper resume. 
I suspect it is because I have old-fashioned taste. Secondly, I do not have enough knowledge and insight to make my resume more creative.
Despite a little experience in web development, I tried to add more animation in photos, skills, animated background color, carousel.

#### Layout
I have divided the resume into two parts.
On the left I put personal information, skills and hobbies. In the right - education, work experience, projects

#### Colors
I used purple, blue and a little pink. 
Blue was chosen because of the clothes in the photo, purple seemed to me quite restrained, unobtrusive and at the same time memorable.
I guess it's a bad idea to put such a photo on a resume. 
It should not have sunglasses and a camera, but unfortunately I have no other photo.

#### Libraries and Frameworks used
* Bootstrap 
* Javascript 
* CSS

#### Problems
Gross grammatical errors /slills/. =) 
Problems with structure.
I could not change the background in the slider, I only managed to make the slider navigation buttons pink.

#### User testing
Two people tested my website. 
The first person was my sister, who not relatid with Computer Science, she said it looks nice
The second was my classmate, she helped with some issue, and she said that it has clear design and interesting small details like animated user pic, skills bar and carousel

#### Considerations
Obviously, my teacher has a good teaching abilities if she can teach an adult in their after 40s from scratch to do so. Thank you for your patience.
